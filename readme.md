## A sweet React Native App 

I love React Native and used it for few years.
This boilerplate was originally for my projects and I realize that it can help others. So just enjoy!ðŸ”¥

## Get started

To bootstrap your React Native App run the CLI:
```shell
$ npx pakenative-cli new myApp
```

## TODO
- [ ] Add multiple options 
- [ ] Add some styles
- [ ] Manage forms with formik and validation with zod
- [ ] Set the redux store
- [ ] Add more components and more screens
- [ ] Add tests
